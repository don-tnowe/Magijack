# Magijack

A roguelike-like deckbuilder game with mechanics inspired by rules of Blackjack. It expands the idea with a card deck built over the course of the run, and spells that require specific types of cards to be used.

    Take as many as you wish... just stop before they hit you back.

The repository contains all assets for the game, including code. Code might be messy, but the project utilizes many useful features of Godot.
