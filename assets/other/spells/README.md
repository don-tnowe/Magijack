# SPELLS

Please note: you can only (FOR SOME REASON) edit these with an external text editor.

What's more dangerous: if you edit and then save in Godot, your changes will be lost. Please reload the project in engine first.

Should find a better way to conveniently edit spell data AND add different functions.

MAYBE it is because an instance of a script is created and the spell data onject gives it a reference to itself. So cyclic reference. At least i think it broke once i did that
